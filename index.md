## *Renaming Files with Python*
Simple Python scripts can be used for a variety of tasks. Today, we will be learning how to use Python to rename multiples files within a folder. 
1. To get started, locate the folder that contains the files you wish to rename and open the Python Interactive Terminal, or another prefered coding area.
2. Next, in the terminal, we must use *import os* in order to begin working with our files. 

``` python
  import os
```
